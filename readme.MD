# MotivMate
MotivMate is a goal tracking app built for iOS using React Native and Expo. The app helps users set and track their goals, and provides motivational reminders to keep them on track.

## Setup
To run MotivMate on your local machine, you'll need to have Node.js and Expo CLI installed. Here's how to install Expo CLI:

Open a terminal and run the following command:
```npm install -g expo-cli```

Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/motivmate.git```

Install dependencies:
```cd motivmate```
```npm install```

Start the app:
```npx expo start```

This will start the Expo development server, and you'll be able to view the app in the Expo app on your iOS device, or in a simulator on your computer.
